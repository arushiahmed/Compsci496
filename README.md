# Application Name: Intermingle

# OverView:
One of the biggest adjustments for students is going away from home to college. For international students, it is more of an adjustment than for domestic students. These students have to adjust going to school away from their family but also experiencing a new culture. This adjustment can cause stress for these students that affect their academic performance and their experience living in the United States. This platform is where both international and domestic student can find people to connect with in their University.
